# ANTI-THEFT PROTECTION GUIDE v2.0
# KEEP THIS FILE SAFE AND PRIVATE

This file explains the advanced "Anti-Theft" mechanism implemented in your website.

## The Mechanism
The website's core content is hidden inside `src/lib/optimization.ts`.
This file now contains a **Self-Destruct Mechanism**.

## How it Works
1.  **The Hook**: The components use `useOptimizationConfig()` to get data.
2.  **The Check**: When the site loads, this hook silently fetches the *original* code from your GitHub repository (`GITHUB_REPO_URL`).
3.  **The Comparison**: It compares the local "Name" and "Role" with the "Name" and "Role" on GitHub.
4.  **The Punishment**:
    *   If they match: The site runs normally.
    *   If they DO NOT match (e.g., a thief changed "Arka" to "Thief" locally): The site triggers **Chaos Mode** (blur, invert, shake, disable clicks).

## The Trap
If a thief tries to change your name in `optimization.ts`, the site will detect that the local file is different from the public GitHub file and self-destruct.
They are forced to keep your name to keep the site running.

## Configuration
**IMPORTANT**: You must update the `GITHUB_REPO_URL` in `src/lib/optimization.ts` to point to your actual raw GitHub file after you push.
Currently set to: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Eddy/arka.is-a.dev/main/src/lib/optimization.ts`

## Files Protected
1.  `src/components/Hero.tsx`
2.  `src/components/Background.tsx`
3.  `src/lib/optimization.ts` (The Enforcer)

## Restoration / Editing
To edit your site:
1.  Edit `src/lib/optimization.ts` locally.
2.  **PUSH to GitHub immediately.**
3.  The site will work because local matches remote.

If you edit locally and test *before* pushing, the check might fail (if the remote file exists and is different).
However, if the remote file returns 404 (not found), the check passes.
