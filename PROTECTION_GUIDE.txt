# ANTI-THEFT PROTECTION GUIDE v3.0
# KEEP THIS FILE SAFE AND PRIVATE

This file explains the advanced "Anti-Theft" mechanism implemented in your website.

## The Mechanism
The website's security is now centralized in `src/lib/sys-core.ts` (obfuscated as a telemetry module).
It works in tandem with `src/components/ui/SystemFailure.tsx` to lock down the site if tampering is detected.

## How it Works
1.  **Domain Verification**: The site checks if it is running on `https://arka-ui.github.io/portfolio/` (or `localhost` for dev).
    *   If it detects it's running on a thief's domain or incorrect path, it triggers a critical system failure.
2.  **Integrity Check**: It silently fetches `src/lib/optimization.ts` from your official GitHub repository.
    *   It verifies that the "Name" and "Role" in the remote file match the expected values.
    *   If a thief changes the name locally but can't change your GitHub repo, the site self-destructs.

## The Punishment
If any check fails, the `SystemFailure` component takes over the entire screen.
It displays a fake "CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED" BSOD-style error to confuse the thief.
It looks like a deep system error, making them think they broke the code, not that they triggered a trap.

## Configuration
**IMPORTANT**:
1.  **Official URL**: The code expects `https://arka-ui.github.io/portfolio/`. This is heavily obfuscated in `src/lib/sys-core.ts`.
2.  **GitHub URL**: Ensure `TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT` in `src/lib/sys-core.ts` points to your raw `optimization.ts` file.

## Files Protected
1.  `src/lib/sys-core.ts` (The Brain - Obfuscated)
2.  `src/components/ui/SystemFailure.tsx` (The Jail)
3.  `src/app/layout.tsx` (The Gatekeeper)

## Restoration / Editing
To edit your site:
1.  Edit locally on `localhost` (Bypassed).
2.  **PUSH to GitHub immediately.**
3.  Deploy.
4.  The deployed site will verify against the GitHub code.

If you deploy code that doesn't match GitHub (e.g., you changed your name but didn't push), the site will fail.
ALWAYS PUSH CHANGES TO GITHUB BEFORE DEPLOYING.
